# Synthetic Retirement Backtest

Synthetic retirement is an extrapolation of the extremely popular [**Trinity Study**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study) paper that was published in 1998.

While the Trinity Study is referenced consistently in the FIRE and general financial community, the datapoints for retirement can be improved upon specifically by simulating more 30-year subsets of retirement. More specifically, on a month-to-month basis instead of on a year-to-year basis. This adjustment results in 12x more retirement timeframes to backtest.

Other withdrawal strategies will also be explored.

In addition, this will also attempt to backtest the 'accuracy' of the '7% rule' which is used to project investment returns.

## Data

The data is taken from [**Robert Shiller's Stock market data from Irrational Exuberance -- Princeton University Press 2000, Broadway Books 2001, 2nd ed., 2005**](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm).

## Future decisions

A fork of this repository will likely be made to house a python/jupyter notebook version for use with future Machine Learning applications.
